# Emotion-Recognition-CNN
This project focuses on recognizing facial emotions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the RAF-DB dataset. The model classifies facial expressions into seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral. Integrated real-time detection using Haar Cascade to predict emotions directly from a live video feed.
